Christmas Pyramid is a holiday themed version of the addition-based solitaire card game Pyramid! Using a shuffled array of 52 playing cards, 28 cards are drawn at random to be aligned in a 7-row pyramid. The remaining 24 cards will be placed face up in a stock pile. The goal of the game is to clear the pyramid by selecting 2 cards that add up to a total of 13. You can only click a card that isn't covered up by another card, so you have to clear the pyramid from the bottom up. If no moves are available on the pyramid, you can flip the card from the stock pile over to the waste pile until you get a card you can play, and you can draw from the top of either deck. The game is won when the entire pyramid is cleared, and if you go through the whole stock pile 3 times without clearing the pyramid, then the game is over. Each card has a pair it can match with, except the King that can be cleared on the first click because it has a value of 13. The suit of the card is not important for this game, and the card pairs and their corresponding values that add up to 13 are shown below:
- Ace (1) & Queen (12)
- Two (2) and Jack (11)
- Three (3) and Ten (10)
- Four (4) and Nine (9)
- Five (5) and Eight (8)
- Six (6) and Seven (7)
